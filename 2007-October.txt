Subject: [Jmikmod-discuss] Java Mod Applet
Message-ID: <13237.21826.qm@web63509.mail.re1.yahoo.com>

Greetings,

Is there a way to use the java version of mikmod as an applet, or under java web start?

If so are their examples of this someplace I can examine, showing how to start/stop playback?

Would a gui be possible?


Thanks,


David

There should be. You can always run it under a separate thread.

I don't know.

Possibly.

Note that MikMod for Java plays some MOD files completely incorrectly.
