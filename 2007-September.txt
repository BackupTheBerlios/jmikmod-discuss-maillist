Subject: [Jmikmod-discuss] Can't run it
Message-ID: <46D9A6E0.1050406@gmail.com>

Hi all members (if anybody is reading this)
I am new here and I am really interested in Jmikmod, because I am 
looking for some MOD, XM, S3M,... player for my mobile phone. It is Sony 
Ericsson W800i. I have downloaded the latest version from the project 
website (one jar file), but I could not even install it in my phone. I 
realised that the manifest.mf file is bad, so I created a new one, which 
was OK (it was generated by the java toolkit from Sony Ericsson). Now I 
am able to install the midlet into my phone, but I can't run it, it says 
"Error in application".
I have downloaded the source code too and was looking for some kind of 
Java J2ME compiler on google, but found only junk and nothing usable.
I hope this project is not dead yet and that somebody will kindly 
respond me.
Thanks in advance,
Mek

I wrote MikMod for Java, but I have no idea how to run it on a J2ME phone. 
Sorry.
